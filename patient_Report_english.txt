Summary
The kidney report shows that you have two kidney stones, both located in your left kidney. The sizes of the stones are approximately 2.9 mm wide and 2.5 mm high for one stone, and 3.3 mm wide and 3.1 mm high for the other stone. 
To manage your condition, consider the following suggestions:
- Lifestyle tips: Drink plenty of water (at least 8-10 glasses a day) to help flush out the stones. Limit your sodium intake and avoid crash diets. Exercise regularly, but avoid heavy lifting or bending.
- Diet advice: Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid foods high in oxalate (like spinach, beets, and rhubarb), sodium, and animal protein. Increase your consumption of foods rich in calcium (like milk, cheese, and yogurt) and citrate (like lemons and oranges).
- Follow-up actions: Ask your doctor about the best treatment options for your kidney stones, such as medication or surgery. Discuss any concerns or questions you have, like "What are the chances of the stones passing on their own?" or "How can I prevent future kidney stones?" Schedule regular check-ups to monitor the size and location of the stones.
